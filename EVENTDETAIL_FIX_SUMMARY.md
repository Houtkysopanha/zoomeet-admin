# EventDetail Ticket Loading Fix

## Problem Identified
The EventDetail component was not properly loading tickets because:
1. The event ID was not being passed correctly from the CustomerBooking component
2. The original API data was stored in `_originalData` but not being used
3. No URL parameter was being set to track selected events
4. No loading/error states for better UX

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Event Data Passing (`CustomerBookng.vue`)
- **Problem**: Event object was transformed but the original API data (containing the real `id`) was stored in `_originalData`
- **Solution**: Modified `selectEvent()` to pass the complete event data including the original API fields:

```javascript
const selectEvent = (event) => {
  const eventForDetail = {
    id: event._originalData.id,  // ‚úÖ Now passes the real UUID
    title: event.title,
    // ... other display fields
    ...event._originalData       // ‚úÖ Include all original API data
  };
  
  selectedEvent.value = eventForDetail;
  visible.value = true;
};
```

### 2. Added URL Parameter Tracking
- **Problem**: No way to track which event is selected in the URL
- **Solution**: Added `eventId` query parameter when event is selected:

```javascript
// Update URL to include event ID
router.replace({
  ...route,
  query: {
    ...route.query,
    eventId: event._originalData.id  // ‚úÖ URL now contains event ID
  }
});
```

### 3. Enhanced EventDetail Component (`EventDetail.vue`)
- **Problem**: Poor error handling and no loading states
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive loading and error states:

```javascript
const tickets = ref([])
const ticketsLoading = ref(false)
const ticketsError = ref('')

// Enhanced watch function with better logging
watch(() => props.selectedEvent, async (newEvent) => {
  console.log('üîç EventDetail received event:', newEvent);
  
  if (newEvent?.id) {
    ticketsLoading.value = true
    // ... load tickets with proper error handling
  }
})
```

### 4. Improved Ticket Display
- **Problem**: Hardcoded ticket types and poor styling
- **Solution**: Dynamic ticket rendering with:
  - Loading spinner during API calls
  - Error messages with retry options
  - "No tickets available" state
  - Dynamic badge colors based on ticket type
  - Proper price formatting
  - Quantity controls with ticket ID (not type)

### 5. URL State Management
- **Auto-load from URL**: If someone visits with `?eventId=123`, the event is auto-selected
- **URL cleanup**: When sidebar closes, eventId is removed from URL
- **Bookmarkable URLs**: Users can bookmark/share event-specific URLs

## Technical Flow

1. **User clicks event card** ‚Üí `selectEvent(event)` called
2. **Event data prepared** ‚Üí Original API data with real UUID extracted  
3. **URL updated** ‚Üí `?eventId=abc-123-def` added to URL
4. **Sidebar opens** ‚Üí EventDetail component receives proper event object
5. **Tickets loaded** ‚Üí `getEventTicketTypes(eventId)` called with real UUID
6. **Success/Error handled** ‚Üí Loading states and error messages shown
7. **URL cleaned** ‚Üí When sidebar closes, eventId removed from URL

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Proper Event Identification**: Real UUIDs used for API calls
‚úÖ **Bookmarkable URLs**: URLs now contain event context  
‚úÖ **Better UX**: Loading states, error handling, empty states
‚úÖ **Debugging**: Comprehensive console logging for troubleshooting
‚úÖ **URL State Sync**: Browser back/forward works correctly
‚úÖ **Shareable Links**: Users can share direct links to specific events

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Go to `/admin/booking`
2. Click any event card
3. Check browser URL contains `?eventId=...`
4. Check browser console for ticket loading logs
5. Verify tickets display correctly in sidebar
6. Close sidebar and verify URL is cleaned
7. Refresh page with eventId in URL to test auto-selection

The flow now properly maintains event context throughout the booking process and provides better user experience with proper loading states and error handling.
