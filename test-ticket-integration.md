# Ticket Types Integration Test Guide

## Overview
This guide helps you test the dynamic ticket types functionality in the EventDetail component.

## Features Implemented

1. **Dynamic Ticket Loading**: Tickets are now loaded from the API using `getEventTicketTypes()`
2. **Loading States**: Shows loading spinner while fetching tickets
3. **Error Handling**: Displays error messages if ticket loading fails
4. **Empty State**: Shows appropriate message when no tickets are available
5. **Ticket Availability**: Handles available/unavailable tickets
6. **Quantity Management**: Respects maximum available quantities
7. **Price Calculation**: Correctly calculates subtotals with dynamic pricing

## Testing Steps

### 1. Basic Functionality
- Navigate to the booking page (`/admin/booking`)
- Select an event from the grid/list
- The EventDetail sidebar should open
- Click on "Select Ticket" tab
- Verify that tickets are loading (spinner should show briefly)

### 2. Ticket Display
- Check that real ticket types from the API are displayed
- Verify ticket names, descriptions, and prices are correct
- Ensure ticket availability status is shown
- Test quantity controls (+/- buttons)

### 3. Error Scenarios
To test error handling:
- Select an event without any configured ticket types
- Check network connectivity issues
- Verify proper error messages are displayed

### 4. Payment Flow
- Select tickets with different quantities
- Verify subtotal calculation is correct
- Test voucher application
- Check tax calculation
- Ensure total is accurate

### 5. Booking Completion
- Fill in quantities for desired tickets
- Select payment method
- Click "Complete Booking"
- Check console for booking details output
- Verify sidebar closes after booking

## Code Changes Made

### EventDetail.vue
1. Added dynamic ticket loading with `getEventTicketTypes()`
2. Implemented loading, error, and empty states
3. Enhanced ticket display with availability checks
4. Improved quantity management with validation
5. Updated booking completion with proper data structure

### CustomerBookng.vue
1. Updated event handler to receive booking details
2. Changed event binding from `@book-now` to `@complete-booking`

## API Integration
- Uses `getEventTicketTypes(eventId)` from `composables/api.js`
- Handles authentication and error responses
- Transforms API data to component format

## Error Handling
- Network errors are caught and displayed
- Invalid event IDs are handled gracefully
- Empty responses show appropriate messages
- Loading states prevent user confusion

## Data Flow
1. User selects event → `selectEvent()` called
2. EventDetail receives event data → `loadTicketTypes()` triggered  
3. API call made → `getEventTicketTypes(eventId)`
4. Response transformed → Tickets displayed
5. User selects tickets → Quantities updated
6. User completes booking → Data emitted to parent

## Future Enhancements
- Add customer info integration from parent component
- Implement actual booking API call
- Add success/confirmation notifications
- Add ticket validation (seat selection, etc.)
- Implement real-time availability updates
